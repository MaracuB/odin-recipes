    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Saag paneer is a delicious, healthy, Indian dish. It is mainly made from onions, tomatoes, spinach and paneer
        (a type of Indian cheese). 
        You can eat paneer as a side dish, or with rice, or naan, whatever you prefer!</p>
    
    <p>It is not very hard to make, but it is important to use tasty spinach. If you like, you can also blend your spinach
        mixture in a blender to ensure a smoother texture</p>
